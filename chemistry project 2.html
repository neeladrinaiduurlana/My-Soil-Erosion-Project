    <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">What is soil Erosion?</h2>
    <p>Soil erosion is the denudation or wearing away of the upper layer of soil. It is a form of soil degradation. This natural process is caused by the dynamic activity of  erosive agents, that is water, ice, snow, air, plants, humans,and animals. The effect of soil erosion is fertile land, increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">What are the causes of soil Erosion?</h3>
    <p>Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion.</p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 30px;">What are the 4 main reasons causes of soil Erosion?</h4>
    <li>WATER : Water is the most common cause of soil erosion</li>
    <li>WIND : Wind is the most common cause of soil erosion.</li>
    <li>ICE : We don't get much ice here in lawrenceville, GA, but for those that do, the concept is the same as water</li>
    <li>GRAVITY : Gravity is a primary culprit behind the three other causes</li>
    <h5 style="font-size: 30px;">What are the signs of soil erosion?</h5>
    <p>As soil erodes the topsoil becomes thinner. Where all topsoil has eroded the soil surface may appear hard and pavement-like or course and gravelly if finer material has been removed. Underlying rock may also be exposed. As land begins to slipdown the slope, small cracks will appear above the slip.</p>

    <h6 style="font-size: 30px;">How is erosion harmful?</h6>
    <p>It has lead to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers, clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species.</p>
    <h7 style="font-size: 30px;">What are the 5 effects of erosion?</h7>
    <li>reduced ability of the soil to store water and nutrients.</li>
    <li>exposure of subsoil, which often has poor physical and chemical properties.</li>
    <li>higher rates of runoff, shedding water and  nutrients otherwise used for crop growth.</li>
    <li>loss if newly planted crops.</li>
    <li>deposits of silt in low-lying areas.</li>
    <h8 style="font-size: 30px;">How can we controll soil erosion?</h8>
    <p>Maintain a healthy, perennial plant cover. Mulching. Planting a cover crop - such as winter rye in vegetable gardens. Includes annual grasses, small grains, legumes and other types of vegetative cover.</p>
